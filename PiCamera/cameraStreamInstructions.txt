To do it the n00b way:
raspivid -o - -t 0 -fps 30| cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' :demux=h264
This method is MUCH simpler but does introduce a noticeably higher latency and lower framerate

Instructions from https://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/tutorials/rtsp-server/
I set up uv4l which has a much lower latency.  Once the PiCamera is registered (on mine it is device 4 -- notice video4 in following command), type the following into the terminal:
dd if=/dev/video0 bs=1M | cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' --demux=h264

The following command theoretically should work but kept hanging for me (buggy vlc).  Use the above instead
cvlc -vvv v4l2c:///dev/video0:width=640:height=480:chroma=H264 --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' --demux h264


Doing this to have the stream begin as soon as the rpi launches:

Currently, I have to run the command beginning with 'cvlc' command, which mentions there are no matches for 'any'.
Then, running the original command succeeds.  No idea why this works only in this order.

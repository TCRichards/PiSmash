The goal of the Raspberry Pi is to be able to stream video immediately upon startup so that we don't have
SSH on every time we want the program to start.  I accomplished this using a variety of complicated tools, so
this guide should help others (and me) do the same.

The library used for streaming is called uv4l. It's very similar to raspivid and other more conventional libraries
but offers SIGNIFICANTLY lower latencies by taking a few shortcuts.

Instructions on downloading and setting up uv4l at:
https://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/installation/
To be safe, download every recommended additional capability, since I'm not sure which capabilities my solution is using.

Once the uv4l library is set up, we can following the instructions below to stream to a RTSP server using the command line:
https://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/tutorials/rtsp-server/
The two commands you'll need from the command line are:

dd if=/dev/video0 bs=1M | cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' --demux=h264

cvlc -vvv v4l2c:///dev/video0:width=640:height=480:chroma=H264 --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' --demux h264

For me, I found that I could only get consistent performance by running the second command followed by the first.

In order to automate these commands, I placed them in a Python script: PiCamera/streamRTSP.py, which
uses a few tricks to emulate launching the second command from the command line for 5 seconds, kills
it, then launches the first.

In order to have the program executed at boot, you must edit the Raspberry Pi's crontab file using

sudo crontab -e

At the bottom, beneath all of the file's comments, add the following line:

@reboot sudo python3 /home/pi/PiSmash/PiCamera/streamRTSP.py &

Make sure to include 'sudo', which is necessary for all root programs, use Python3, use your corresponding
path to the file (although I bet they're all the same), and add the & to allow the system to boot while
this program is being executed (because it never ends and would otherwise hog the CPU)

In order to get VLC to run on startup, you have to give it root access.  This is accomplished via the
following command into the terminal:

$ sudo sed -i 's/geteuid/getppid/' /usr/bin/vlc


After all these are accomplished, your Raspberry Pi should begin streaming video whenever it's powered on.
To return it to normal, simply remove the extra line in crontab using: sudo crontab -e
